# Creating with pptxgenjs

Script paths below are relative to the skill root.

Check whether `pptxgenjs` is available before installing it. Resolve missing dependencies in the project or a task-specific scratch directory. These are the known failure cases:

- **Set `pres.layout` before adding slides.** The default canvas is `LAYOUT_16x9` = **10" × 5.625"**, not 13.3" wide. Coordinates past the edge are written, not clamped — the shape just isn't on the slide. (`LAYOUT_WIDE` is 13.3" × 7.5".)
- **Hex colors: never `#`, never 8 digits.** `color: "FF0000"`. Both `"#FF0000"` and alpha baked into the hex (`"00000020"`) **corrupt the file**. For translucency: `transparency: 0-100` on fills and images, `opacity: 0.0-1.0` on shadows — each is silently ignored on the other.
- **pptxgenjs mutates option objects in place** (converts values to EMU on first use). Never share one `shadow`/options object across two `add*` calls — build a fresh object each time.
- **Shadow `offset` must be ≥ 0** — a negative offset corrupts the file. To cast a shadow upward, use `angle: 270` with a positive offset.
- **`letterSpacing` is silently ignored** — the real option is `charSpacing`.
- **Lists:** `bullet: true` on each item, never a literal `•` (renders double bullets). Set `breakLine: true` on every array item except the last. Space bulleted paragraphs with `paraSpaceAfter`, not `lineSpacing` (huge gaps).
- **One `new pptxgen()` per output file** — never reuse an instance.
- **`rectRadius` only works on `ROUNDED_RECTANGLE`**, not `RECTANGLE`.
- **Gradient fills aren't supported** — use a gradient image as the background instead.
- **Text boxes have built-in internal padding** — set `margin: 0` whenever text must align with a shape, line, or icon at the same x.
- **Speaker notes go in `slide.addNotes("...")`** (plain text, once per slide), never in a text box on the slide.
- **Keep charts native.** Use `addChart()` for everything PowerPoint can chart (pass an array of `{type, data, options}` for combos). For PowerPoint-native features the library doesn't expose (trendlines, error bars), compute the extra series yourself or post-process the generated OOXML — do not fall back to a rendered image. Only chart types PowerPoint has no native form for (Sankey, network, chord) go in as images.
- **Default charts render bare** — no title, no data labels, dated palette. Set `showTitle` + `title`, `showValue: true` + `dataLabelPosition`, `chartColors: [...]` from your palette, and quiet the frame (`catAxisLabelColor`/`valAxisLabelColor`, `valGridLine: { color, size }`, `catGridLine: { style: "none" }`, `showLegend: false` for a single series).
- **On a stacked bar or column chart, `dataLabelPosition` must be `ctr`, `inEnd`, or `inBase`.** `outEnd` **corrupts the file**.
- **A combo series using `secondaryValAxis`/`secondaryCatAxis` needs both `valAxes` and `catAxes` on the chart options, two entries each.** Without them pptxgenjs writes axis *ids* it never declares, and PowerPoint **discards that chart** and reports the file as corrupt. Supplying only `valAxes` is not enough.
- **After `writeFile()`, run `python scripts/office/validate.py deck.pptx`.** It reports the two chart faults above and the slide-XML defects PowerPoint refuses, and names the fix for each. Fix them in your generator, not by hand-editing the packed XML.
- **Never reorder the children of `<p:presentation>`.** pptxgenjs writes `<p:notesMasterIdLst>` right after `<p:sldIdLst>` and points both masters at one theme part. PowerPoint reads that happily — move the element and the same deck becomes unopenable.
- **Icons:** render `react-icons` to SVG (`ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup`), rasterize with `sharp` at ≥256px, and insert via `addImage({ data: "image/png;base64," + buf.toString("base64") })` — the `image/png;base64,` prefix is required. Check these packages are available; install missing dependencies in the task environment.
