# Quality checks

Script paths are relative to the skill root. Run conversions in a dedicated scratch directory so stale-render cleanup cannot delete another task's images.

Check the output for content, file validity, and visible defects. Fix actual issues and recheck affected slides; do not manufacture a revision when the output already passes.

### Content QA

```bash
markitdown output.pptx
```

Check for missing content, typos, wrong order.

**When using templates, check for leftover placeholder text:**

```bash
markitdown output.pptx | grep -iE "\bx{3,}\b|lorem|ipsum|\bTODO|\[insert|this.*(page|slide).*layout"
```

If grep returns results, fix them before declaring success.

### File QA (required)

```bash
python scripts/office/validate.py output.pptx                      # built from scratch
python scripts/office/validate.py output.pptx --original src.pptx  # built from a template
```

**If the deck came from a template, always pass `--original`.** A template may itself
contain parts the XSD rejects, so a bare run can report failures you never caused — and
a genuine regression can hide among them. `--original` baselines
the schema and slide checks against the template, suppressing errors it already had.
The structural checks — relationships, content types, charts — ignore `--original` and
report template-inherited problems either way, so read those on their own merits.

pptxgenjs emits chart XML PowerPoint refuses to open, and every other tool
accepts: python-pptx opens those decks, LibreOffice renders them, the XSD
passes them. Every failure names its fix. Fix it in the generator and rebuild.

### Visual QA

For a new deck or broad template edit, inspect every slide. For a localized edit, inspect affected slides; include the whole deck if shared layouts, fonts, or themes changed. Render with the commands under [Converting to images](#converting-to-images). Inspect the rendered images independently of the generating code. User-visible defects to look for:

- **Text overflow or text cut off at a box or slide boundary — check this first.** It is the most common defect and always user-visible. (Font substitutions can change text width; inspect the fonts available to the renderer and leave slack where metrics differ.)
- Overlapping elements (text through shapes, lines through words, stacked elements)
- Source citations or footers colliding with content above
- Elements too close (< 0.3" gaps) or cards/sections nearly touching
- Uneven gaps (large empty area in one place, cramped in another)
- Insufficient margin from slide edges (< 0.5")
- Columns or similar elements not aligned consistently
- Low-contrast text (e.g., light gray text on cream-colored background)
- Template decoration mispositioned after text replacement — e.g., a title underline positioned for one line, but the replaced title wrapped to two
- Low-contrast icons (e.g., dark icons on dark backgrounds without a contrasting circle)
- Text boxes too narrow causing excessive wrapping
- Leftover placeholder content

## Converting to Images

Convert presentations to individual slide images for visual inspection:

```bash
python scripts/office/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf output.pptx
rm -f slide-*.jpg
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 output.pdf slide
ls -1 "$PWD"/slide-*.jpg
```

**Pass the absolute paths printed above directly to the view tool.** The `rm` clears stale images from prior runs. `pdftoppm` zero-pads based on page count: `slide-1.jpg` for decks under 10 pages, `slide-01.jpg` for 10-99, `slide-001.jpg` for 100+.

**After fixes, rerun all four commands above** — the PDF must be regenerated from the edited `.pptx` before `pdftoppm` can reflect your changes.
