- Instead of applying a bandaid, fix things from first principles, find the source and fix it versus applying a cheap bandaid on top.
- Clean up unused code ruthlessly. If a function no longer needs a parameter or a helper is dead, delete it and update the callers instead of letting the junk linger.
- Always use Context7 MCP when you need library/API documentation
